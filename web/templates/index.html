            We have been developing software for over 15 years but
            over the last 5 we've been working as independent consultants
            and freelancers, building successful software
            for <b>over 30 different seed and early stage companies</b> in,
            and around Central, Ohio. Now, we've combined forces to build
            the most experienced, startup focused, software development agency in Ohio.

                    <h2>The 7 Deadly Sins of Software Agility.</h2>

                    <p>Everyone has heard of the unicorn Agile team who moves at lightspeed yet when businesses
                    try to implement Agile processes they often fail. This list highlights the most common
                    problems that we've seen with Agile implementations in our clients.</p>

                    <h3>#1 — Lack of Commitment</h3>
                    <p>One of the most dangerous myths surrounding Agile is that it can fit snugly within your
                    existing engineering processes. This isn't true. The core elements that make up an Agile
                    framework are heavily interdependent, and removing them in an attempt to keep your existing
                    processes will result in greatly diminished returns on your investment.
                    </p>

                    <h3>#2 — Poor Team Stability</h3>
                    <p>There are few things as damaging to your team velocity as team instability. Agility
                    depends on well functioning teams that have taken the time to gel. Every time you hire, fire,
                    or move someone between teams, you will experience a nose dive in productivity. This is
                    especially true of startups who have high contractor and consultant turnover.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
                    <h3>#3 — Poor Testing Habits</h3>
                    <p>In the very early stages of a startup, investing in well tested software is a
                    mistake. The point at this stage is to validate the business. You should build a quick,
                    and dirty prototype. However, it would be a mistake to take that untested and
                    unstable prototype and try to shove it into production. Throw it away! Building
                    the same software from scratch in a test driven approach will net you huge
                    gains (often a lot sooner than you think).
                    </p>

                    <h3>#4 — Blocking Code Reviews</h3>
                    <p>We're big fans of code review at Blueshift. We review each other's code
                    constantly and we pair together on solutions as many chances as we get. However,
                    we often see code review being abused by teams as a collaboration tool.
                    Teams should collaborate before a single line of code is ever written, not
                    after the code is written and submitted for review. Code review is a place
                    for empathic feedback, mentorship, and learning. It should never block
                    others from getting their work done.
                    </p>

                    <h3>#5 — Refactoring Too Early</h3>
                    <p>This is a big engineering canary-in-the-coal-mine. Agile tells
                    us to avoid big up-front design. Still, many programmers when
                    given requirements for simple problems build large complex (and
                    sometime convoluted) software architectures. Nearly always,
                    a simpler more straight forward approach is superior. You should
                    never do more work, than what is required to meet the current
                    requirements.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
                    <h3>#6 — Not Refactoring Enough</h3>
                    <p>However, all code eventually reaches a size where it becomes increasingly costly
                    to implement new features. One of the worst things you can do is
                    ignore this and pile on tech-debt. Unlike most debt, tech-debt has a very
                    high interest rate. It should be sought out and destroyed as often as
                    possible. Your team should constantly be reworking, refactoring, and
                    rearchitecting the codebase as new features are implemented.
                    </p>

                    <h3>#7 — Fear of Failure</h3>
                    <p>You are going to introduce bugs in your code, you are going to miss
                    deadlines, and you are going to eventually put breaking software into
                    production. It happens to everyone, and it is unavoidable. The key to
                    success, is being able to respond to these mistakes as fast as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>Be bold. Try risky things, but have an engine in place to recover
                    from them quickly. If you are delivering every day, and you break
                    something, it will be broken for a day. If you are releasing once a
                    month, and you break something, it will be broken for a month. You're
                    going to break something eventually, so you might as well <b>move fast</b>.
                    </p>
