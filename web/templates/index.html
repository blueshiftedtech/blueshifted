								<h2>The 7 Deadly Sins of Software Agility.</h2>

                                <p>Everyone has heard of the unicorn Agile team who moves at lightspeed yet when businesses 
                                try to implement Agile processes they often fail. This list highlights the most common 
                                problems that we've seen with Agile implementations in our clients.</p>

                                <h3>#1 — Lack of Committment</h3>
                                <p>One of the most dangerous myths surrounding Agile is that it can fit snugly within your
                                existing engineering processes. This isn't true. The core elements that make up an Agile 
                                framework are heavily interdependent, and removing them in an attempt to keep your existing
                                processes will result in greatly diminished returns on your investment.
                                </p>

                                <h3>#2 — Poor Team Stability</h3>
                                <p>There are few things as damaging to your team velocity as team instability. Agility 
                                depends on well functioning teams that have taken the time to gel. Everytime you hire, fire,
                                or move someone between teams, you will experience a nose dive in productivity. This is 
                                especially true of startups who have high contractor and consultant turnover.
                                </p>

							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
                                <h3>#3 — Poor Testing Habits</h3>
                                <p>In the very early stages of a startup, investing in well tested software is a
                                mistake. The point at this stage is to validate the business. You should build a quick,
                                and dirty prototype. That said, it is devestating to your business when you take 
                                that untested and unstable prototype and try to shove it into production. Throw it 
                                away! Building the same software from scratch in a test driven approach will net you
                                huge gains (often a lot sooner than you think).
                                </p>

                                <h3>#4 — Blocking Code Reviews</h3>
                                <p>We're big fans of code review at Blueshift. We review each other's code 
                                constantly and we pair together on solutions as many chances as we get. However, 
                                we often see code review being abused by teams as a collaboration tool.
                                Teams should collaborate before a single line of code is ever written, not
                                after the code is written and submitted for review. Code review is a place
                                for empathic feedback, mentorship, and learning. It should never block 
                                others from getting their work done.
                                </p>

                                <h3>#5 — Refactoring Too Early</h3>
								<p>This is a big engineering canary-in-the-coal-mine. Agile tells 
                                us to avoid big up-front design. Still, many programmers when
                                given requirements for simple problems build large complex (and 
                                sometime convoluted) software architectures. Nearly always, 
                                a simpler more straight forward approach is superior. You should 
                                never do more work, than what is required to meet the current
                                requirements.
                                </p>

							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
                                <h3>#6 — Not Refactoring Enough</h3>
								<p>However, all code eventually reaches a size where it becomes increasingly costly
                                to implement new features. One of the worst things you can do is
                                ignore this and pile on tech-debt. Unlike most debt, tech-debt has a very
                                high interest rate. It should be sought out and destroyed as often as 
                                possible. Your team should constantly be reworking, refactoring, and 
                                rearchitecting the codebase as new features are implemented.
                                </p>

                                <h3>#7 — Fear of Failure</h3>
                                <p>You are going to introduce bugs in your code, you are going to miss 
                                deadlines, and you are going to eventually put breaking software into 
                                production. It happens to everyone, and it is unavoidable. The key to 
                                success, is being able to respond to these mistakes as fast as possible.
                                </p>

                                <p>Be bold. Try risky things, but have an engine in place to recover 
                                from them quickly. If you are delivering every day, and you break 
                                something, it will be broken for a day. If you are releasing once a 
                                month, and you break something, it will be broken for a month. You're
